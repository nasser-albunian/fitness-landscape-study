# What this directory is about
All the data resulting from running the two algorithms (MOSA and RW) should be placed here. 

**Data resulting from MOSA:**

 - **GA\_coverage** directory includes data of coverage achieved by MOSA (file: *CLASS\_GA\_coverage.csv*).
 - **Raw_fitness_GA** directory includes data of raw fitness resulting from running MOSA (file: *CLASS_Branch_Raw_Fitness.csv*).
 - **Statistics** data file (file: *statistics.csv*). Note this is a single file not a directory. 

**Data resulting from RW:**

 - **RW** directory includes data of random walk (file: *CLASS_RW.csv*).
 - **NT** directory includes data of neutral walk (file: *CLASS_NT.csv*).
 - **Methods** directory includes data of all methods in a class under test (file: *CLASS_methods.csv*).
 - **Method_execution_RW** directory includes data of method executions during random walk (file: *CLASS_MethodExecCountRW.csv*).

Note that each directory contains the data files resulting from the *n* runs, for example, 30 runs in the case in our experiment.
